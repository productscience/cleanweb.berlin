<h2>Giving a talk at Cleanweb Berlin</h2>

So, you're thinking of giving talk at a Cleanweb Berlin event? That's very cool of you! To make the process easier for everyone, we'd like to ask you to fill out the form below to let us know a bit more about you and your talk.
Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have questions, though, we're there to help!

#### Audience:
Cleanweb Berlin is a meetup group for people with a combined interest in the web and sustainability. We meet monthly, and members give talks on project they're working on, or subjects they're interested in.

The audience tends to be a mix of:

- sustainability professionals who want to apply their expertise at scale beyond their practice
- people who make a living designing systems or content for the web (designers, developers, bloggers). They typically have an interest in or previous background in sustainability, and want to apply the principles in their day to day work.

#### Experience:
We're open to anyone, from complete beginners to conference veterans - see this site for here for some good reasons for speaking at meetups, and some useful tips: [http://weareallaweso.me](http://weareallaweso.me/)

#### Language:
All talks are in English.

#### Talk Duration:
Full length talks should not be longer than 15 minutes. In addition, there will be 3-5 minutes time for Q&A. We suggest timing your presentation in advance, so we don’t have to cut you off. For lighting talks, aim for 3-5 minutes.

#### Code of Conduct

We subscribe to the <a href="berlincodeofconduct.org">Berlin Code of Conduct </a>. We aim to be a safe and inclusive event, and encourage you to use inclusive language and imagery in your presentation, for example by <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Nonsexist_language">avoiding gendered pronouns</a>. Please reach out anytime if you have questions.
