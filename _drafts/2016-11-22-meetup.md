This month, we're exploring how folks are making planet friendly services that use connected products, and the impact of IoT on the world of environmental sustainability.

**Harnessing Pester Power for the Planet**  
_Philipp Mahr_

About 18 months ago, we met [Hyko,](https://twitter.com/hyko) an IoT-enabled toy polar bear, designed to get parents to save energy round the home. Philipp tells us about Hyok's journey, since meeting a co-founder at one of our first events back in 2014, and the trade-offs manufacturing in both Germany and the Far East.
