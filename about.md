## About Cleanweb Berlin

Cleanweb Berlin is a monthly meetup for web and sustainability professionals in Berlin, first set up in March 2014, to provide a space for interdisciplinary conversation, and sharing ideas between the groups.

You don't need to be an established professional in either field, as long as you have an interested, and you're up for learning something, and you're prepared to follow the [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/)

Attending these meetups is free. Generally you don't need to register to be able to come, but for some events, we may need a provide a list to venue owners, so security can let you in.

It _does_ help us with planning, and catering, so if you can, we'd appreciate it :)

### The Format

We mainly provide this by arranging meetups roughly every month, exploring a specific theme, from at a range of venues around the city.

Roughly each month, we run a meetup on a specific theme, bringing in an expert to give talk introducing the subject to the group, then one or more organisations working in the field to share their experiences, and what they've learned.

We usually round off our events with activities to involve the rest of the group - like open, moderated panel discussions, or various workshop activities.

### Our venues

Cleanweb Berlin has no 'home venue', and we spend a significant amount of time trying to find suitable venues for our events each month.

If you'd like to offer your venue to use we'd _love_ to hear from you, drop us a line at team@cleanweb.berlin, or contact one of our organisers directly below.
