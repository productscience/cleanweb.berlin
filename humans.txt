/* TEAM */

cleanweb Berlin is run by:
- Chris Adams, @mrchrisadams
- Darina Onoprienko, @DOnoprienko
- Anna Yukiko Bickenbach, @BGreenYukiko
- Philipp Mahr, @phimahr

This site is based very, very heavily on the upfront.ug website.

It's largely a fork of their site, after we asked nicely if we could use it
as a basis for our own. So, thanks upfront peeps :)

Special thanks to Martin Spindler (@mjays) for helping with the first year and a half of running the meetups.
