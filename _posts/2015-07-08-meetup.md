Hi Cleanwebbers,

This time we do a Stammtisch to openly discuss climate change, start-ups, technology, sustainability, environmental psychology and all kinds of cleanwebby topics.

We meet at a nice Biergarten close to Schlesisches Tor in the center of Berlin.

### What should expect from this meetup?

Experts, open discussions, inspiring people and drinks.

### What is The Cleanweb?

Cleanweb is about how we can use the web and connecting technologies to save the planet.
