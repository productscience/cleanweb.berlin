Hey Cleanwebbers,

This time round, its the first part of our smart cities series of events. We will kick this off by looking at how energy production and consumption in a 'smart city' can look like.  

So, why should you get energy from a power plant kilometers away, when your neighbour generates more energy with his roof-top solar, CHP or heat pump than he can use?  

- #### 6:30 Doors open
- #### 7:00 Welcome and introductions
- #### 7:10 1st Speaker: Micro girds in urban and industrial environment

  We're lucky enough to have environmental economist [Christian Huder](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=116056294) speaking about his work on  micro grids.

- #### 7:35 Lightning Talks

  Short, fun talks about tech and sustainability. 3-5 mins each.

  We're still looking for speakers, and have two slots going! Curious about giving a talk? [Check our speaker's page _here_](https://docs.google.com/a/productscience.co.uk/forms/d/1THfsECvbwjHbeeaBZt-VUvKy5-1hu7JUyW0ga3gSd-Y/viewform)

- #### 7:45 Break for drinks and networking
- #### 8:10 Community announcements
- #### 8:15 Fishbowl

After the talks, we'll be opening the conversation to the room, with a fishbowl discussion. A fishbowl is like a panel discussion, but open for anyone in the audience to join the stage, to make the most of the knowledge in the room.  

We will go to a nearby bar afterwards.  

### What should I expect from this meetup?

Expert talks, open discussions, inspiring people and drinks. 

Looking forward to meet you in person!
