Can machine learning help us tread more lightly on the planet?

This month, we'll be asking a professor of machine learning is, what it is, why it's important, and hearing from people building businesses around it, to create greener, smarter services.

Next, we'll be opening up the event to audience participation, with a fishbowl session, to give you a chance to explore the subject, from different angles and have your burning questions answered.

Special thanks to the lovely, lovely people at the German Technology Entrepreneurship Center (GTEC), for providing the space, and helping make the event possible.
