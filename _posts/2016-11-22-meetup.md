      desc: "About 18 months ago, we met Hyko, an IoT-enabled toy polar bear, designed to get parents to save energy round the home. Philipp tells us about Hyko's journey, since meeting a co-founder at one of our first events back in 2014, and the trade-offs manufacturing in both Germany and the Far East."
