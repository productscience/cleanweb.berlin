Hello Cleanwebbers,

As temperatures plunge around Berlin, we have two speakers talking about how they're using the web to help Germany stay cozy without cooking the planet.

#### 7:00 Introduction and welcome  

#### 7:10 1st Speaker - The Possibilities of Online Energy Consulting ([@co2online](http://www.twitter.com/@co2online))

  Sebastian Metzger - co2online gGmbH

  CO2online is a non-profit organization campaigning for climate protection, and in 2014 it ran half a million people online energy consulting sessions to help consumers on how to save energy and reduce CO2 emissions. 

#### 7:30 2nd Speaker - Disrupting the heating industry?

  Krisofer Fichtner - thermondo GmbH ([@thermondo](https://twitter.com/Thermondo))

  What does a Berlin startup have to do with German private household heating, master craftsmen and the energy transition?

#### 7:45 Break for drinks and networking

#### 8:10 Community announcements

#### 8:15 Fishbowl

After the talks, we'll be opening the conversation to the room, with a fishbowl discussion. A fishbowl is like a panel discussion, but open for anyone in the audience to join the stage, to make the most of the knowledge in the room.

#### What to expect from this meetup?

Expert talks, open discussions, inspiring people and drinks. 

Looking forward to meet you in person!
