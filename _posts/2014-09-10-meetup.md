Our friends at [Hack4good](https://geekli.st/hackathon/hack4good-06/berlin) are running a cleanwebby Hackday on the [weekend of Sept 12th](https://geekli.st/hackathon/hack4good-06/berlin?tab=about), and we're working together to host a pre-event social at the [Baumhaus](http://www.baumhausberlin.de/about/).

Come along, and chat with other environmentally-minded designers, makers, developers and people with a shared interest in the web, and in sustainability.

### Schedule:

- 6:45 - Doors open
- 7:15 - Welcome and introduction
- 7:20 - Community announcements

Working on an event or project and looking for help? Or wanting to make that elusive hire? Here's your chance.

- 7:25 - Using the web to solve environmental problems - Hack4good
- 8:00 - Drinks, chat, and networking
- 8:30 - Fishbowl session - life beyond hackathons

This month we'll be talking about what options are available to early stage projects, beyond hackathons. How do you keep momentum after an event, and what support is out there to help you?

#### Curious? Come along and join the discussion.

If you're thinking of going to hack4good, or mentoring there, this is a good place to meet others in person, and some of the organising team, to get an idea of how the weekend will go.

If you're just interested in meeting other-like minded people, thinking of giving a talk at a future cleanweb event, come along and help build a community of using the web to make the world a better place.

See you there!
