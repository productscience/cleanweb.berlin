Hey Cleanwebbers,

We're trying out a social meetup this month, while we all recover from the new year, before starting our meetups in earnest in January.

Come to Kaschk to meet some like-minded people with an interest in sustainability, mobility, cleanweb, energy, tech (or all of the above) and  chat, catch up, network and work out what do with 2015.

We'll have a couple of tables reserved for Berlin - come by for a drink or stay the whole evening!
