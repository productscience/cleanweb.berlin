Hey Cleanwebbers,

Its been a while!  

This time we're doing a cozy Stimmtisch with a special guest - Robert (Uhlich), portfolio manager at [Companisto](https://www.companisto.com), the leading crowdinvestment companie in Germany, will give us insights into crowdinvestment, success stories and failures; and all while sitting in a bar over drinks.  

#### What should I expect from this meetup?

This is an informal meetup for people interested in sustainability and using the web as a lever for effective environmental change - we'll have a couple of tables reserved, for everyone to catch up, swap stories and maybe meet someone else to work with on future projects.

#### Do I have to be an expert in sustainability, or a programmer?

No! We're a broad church, so if you're interested, and thinking about dipping your toes in this field, you're very welcome to join :)
